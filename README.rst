How do I...
===========

...specify comaintainers on a new package request?
--------------------------------------------------

Once the package is created you can add other packagers, pseudo-users or groups:

    1. Go to one of your package: https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/<package_name>/
    2. Click on: Manage the committers/watchers/package administrators/main contacts (any of these)
    3. There is then an ``Add`` someone button you can use.
